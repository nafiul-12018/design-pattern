This Go program calculates the MD5 checksums of all regular files in a specified directory using bounded parallelism. It walks through the directory structure, computes the MD5 checksums of the files, and outputs the results sorted by file path.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the code:

1. walkFiles function:
**func walkFiles(done <-chan struct{}, root string) (<-chan string, <-chan error)**

Purpose: This function walks through the directory tree rooted at root, identifying regular files (non-directories, non-symlinks, etc.). It sends the path of each file to a channel paths and any errors encountered to the errc error channel.
done channel: If a signal is received on the done channel, the function stops processing (i.e., cancels the walk).
Concurrency: The directory walk happens in a separate goroutine to allow other parts of the program to work concurrently.
2.** result struct:
  type result struct {
      path string
      sum  [md5.Size]byte
      err  error
  }**
Purpose: This structure holds the path of a file, its MD5 checksum (sum), and any error encountered while reading or processing the file.
3. digester function:
**func digester(done <-chan struct{}, paths <-chan string, c chan<- result)**
Purpose: This function reads file paths from the paths channel and computes the MD5 checksum for each file. The result (file path, checksum, and any error) is sent to the c channel.
done channel: If a signal is received on the done channel, the function stops processing and exits early.
4. MD5All function:
**func MD5All(root string) (map[string][md5.Size]byte, error)**
Purpose: This is the main function that orchestrates the directory walk, checksum calculation, and result collection. It:
Initializes the done channel to control cancellation.
Starts the directory walking process using walkFiles.
Launches multiple worker goroutines (controlled by numDigesters) to compute the MD5 checksums in parallel.
Collects the results into a map where keys are file paths and values are their corresponding MD5 checksums.
Returns the map of results or an error if encountered during the process.
Main Logic Flow:
walkFiles starts a goroutine to traverse the directory structure and sends file paths on the paths channel.
MD5All spawns numDigesters (20) goroutines to process file paths concurrently, with each goroutine reading a file and computing its MD5 checksum.
The results are accumulated in the map m.
If any error occurs (either during the walk or file processing), the function exits early and returns the error.

**5. main function:**
**func main()**
Purpose: The entry point of the program, which:
Calls MD5All with the directory specified by the first command-line argument.
Prints the MD5 checksums of all files in the directory, sorted by file path.
If an error occurs during the execution (such as directory walking or checksum calculation), the error is printed, and the program exits.
Key Concepts:
Concurrency:
Walking through the file tree and computing MD5 checksums are done concurrently to speed up the process. Multiple files are processed in parallel using goroutines.
The done channel is used to signal cancellation across multiple goroutines, ensuring that if an error occurs, the system can stop further processing.
MD5 checksum:
The program reads each file's contents and computes its MD5 hash. This is a common method to verify file integrity or uniqueness.
Example Execution Flow:
The program is run with a directory as an argument: go run main.go /path/to/directory.
The walkFiles function identifies all regular files within the directory and its subdirectories.
Multiple goroutines read these files and compute their MD5 checksums in parallel.
The results are gathered and printed, sorted by file path.
The use of bounded parallelism (20 workers) ensures that the program doesn't overwhelm the system with too many goroutines at once, striking a balance between performance and resource usage.
